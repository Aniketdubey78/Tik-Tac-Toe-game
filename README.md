🧠 Game Logic Summary
- The game board uses a 3×3 grid (HTML table or div structure)
- Moves are handled via click events in JS
- Checks for win conditions after every move
- If vs computer: basic AI uses random or optimal move logic
- Theme toggling uses class switching and local state
- Navigation between pages via buttons and JS redirects

🎯 Future Improvements
- Smart AI (Minimax algorithm)
- Scoreboard or match history
- Sound effects and animations
- Emoji avatars or theme customization
